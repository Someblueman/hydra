## Benefits

- **CI on all branches**: Every push to feature/fix/hotfix/release branches runs CI
- **Protected main**: Can't push directly to main without PR and passing tests
- **Quality gates**: All tests must pass before merging
- **Up-to-date requirement**: Branches must be current with base branch before merge
